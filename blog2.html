                                <p> The Hibiscus rosa-sinensis has the common name of Rose of China, and originated in China. The flowers only last a couple of days, but they do bloom more than once - between spring and fall. The flowers are a kind of trumpet shape and bright in color. These are fairly easy-to-care for, but need plenty of light. </p>
                              <p><strong>Growing</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>size</strong>: Many of these are grown in gardens or indoors as mentioned above, and can grow up to a fair few feet tall and wide. Growing in the home requires them to be pruned to keep there size down to what's suitable for the place it's housed in.</p>
                              <p><strong>How</strong> <strong>they</strong> <strong>look</strong>: The Rose of China is an attractive shrub with shiny dark green, toothed leaves. Five colorful petals bloom and a long staminal column (pollen stalk) sits in the center of the flower. At the right height indoors they look charming.</p>
                              <p><strong>Flowering</strong>: The flowers once fully bloomed will only last for a couple of days, however, they can flower a fair few times. When in blossom one flower will bloom and some varieties will produce two (both with five petals).</p>
                                <p><strong>Other</strong> <strong>uses</strong>: Hibiscus flowers are used for medicinal purposes in china and the flowers are used in some places for adding to meals, such as salads.</p>

                              <p> This plant gets its name from the maple shaped sycamore leaves and not because it's a maple tree type plant. The maple is a fast growing plant that grows up to 5ft tall like a tree. Bell shaped flowers bloom in various colors including pink, red, yellow and orange. Light is something they love and need to grow well. </p>
                              <p><strong>Origin</strong>: The origin of this maple which also has the scientific name of Abutilon x hybridum has not been established and is seen as a cultivar (selective breed).</p>
                              <p><strong>Growing</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>care</strong>: Growing a flowering maple indoors requires enough space ready for when it matures because they can grow up to 5 ft, although your likely to be able to keep it pruned down to 2ft-3ft. They also grow quickly and need to be pruned (see below) to fit your indoor needs. The maple can be taken in to the garden which they are partial to at summer time, but they do not like frosty morning's. A place that gets plenty of sunshine will keep him happy (not hot direct sunlight, though).</p>
                                <p><strong>Flowers</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>foliage</strong>: The leaves for this plant are a a maple type dark green, and the bell shaped flowers bloom beautifully in various colors including, red, yellow, pink, and white. You can expect to see plenty of flowers from these between spring through to fall and possibly later (or earlier).</p>

                              <p> The Flamingo flower blooms outstanding wax effect flowers with a kind of pigs curly orange tail that grows from the stalk through the flower. Although these tropical plants are beautiful they are quite difficult to care for compared to other types. These are a poisonous type of plant, best kept away from pets and kids. </p>
                              <p><strong>Different species: </strong>The A scherzerianum is one of many species from the Anthurium genus (there are many more). Some people are mistaken when they state the A andreanum is the Flamingo flower (it's the oilcloth flower) – which is important to know, because they have differences. The main differences between the flamingo and oilcloth is in size (flamingo is smaller) the leaves are a different shape and the spadix grows straight or slightly bent with the A andreanum (oilcoth). There are also many hybrids available.</p>
                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                              <strong>Growing and care:</strong> These are delightful to grow because of how spledid they look. However, a grower needs to be aware that they need plenty or care and attention (see instructions below) which may not suit the inexperienced grower.
                              <p><strong>How</strong> <strong>they</strong> <strong>look</strong>: The spadix (curly orange stem of very small flowers) and the spathe (what looks like the flower but is a bract -- modified leaf --) look's outstanding. The red colored (other colors are available) spathe has a very distinct glossy look that bloom's usually throughout spring to summer (flowers can last for a few weeks). Lance shaped leaves (long and wider in the middle) are also an attractive feature that grow to approximately 8 inches long. Misting and keeping the plant clean will bring out the best of this plant's appearance.</p>
                                <p><strong>Poisonous</strong>: If digested the plant is poisonous and can cause digestion problems. It's advisable to keep pets (dog's and cat's) well away and prevent personally handling them when re-potting. Wear gloves - to prevent skin irritation.</p>

                              <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Kaffir Lily - Clivia Miniata</a></h3>
                              <p> The Kaffir lily is a flowering house plant that blooms beautiful orange (my favorite), red yellow and cream flowers, in clusters of more than 10. These are fairly easy to care for, however, they may not bloom if not cared for correctly. Its a must to understand the Kaffir's needs and then they're easy enough to maintain while producing flowers. &nbsp; </p>
                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>Growing</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>size</strong>: The K.lily is fairly easy to grow (within a greenhouse, conservatory or house), if basic care instructions are followed (see below). They also enjoy a period of time outdoors at summertime, shaded. It can grow up to 18 inches in height and width once it's fully matured, although they are slow growers so expect two to five years, for full maturity.</p>
                              <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Blooming</strong>: You can expect these to bloom early spring time, although some growers can get them to produce flowers at other times. They can also bloom sporadically at other times..earlier than spring or much later than spring. You will need some patience to see your first years bloom, which could be approximately 2 -3 years. The flowers last for a couple of days and then they should be removed (when they are deteriorating) to allow new growth and others to bloom. When they are in bloom, do avoid moving the plant.</p>
                              <p><strong>How it looks and displaying:</strong> When the Kaffir is in full bloom (usually between spring to summer) it's a beautiful looking species, with approximatively 10 - 20 trumpet shaped, orange petalled and yellow centred flowers. There are also a variety of other colors (red, yellow and white), although these are by far, the most popular. The leaves are a wide straped shape and fairly dark green in colour, which arch over each other. The cluster of flowers produced grow from the end of a stem, so they sit displaying themselves above the foliage.</p>
                              <p><strong>Poisonous</strong>: These should be kept a way from cats and pets that like to nibble plant leaves. They contain a poisonous substance - called Lycorine. In small doses it may upset the stomach and the digestive system, however, large amounts can be dangerous.</p>
                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>Flowering</strong>: Some growers have just been fortunate that theirs has bloomed while others have had to make the conditions right. Many have never seen one bloom in years (like me). The general advice is at the end of summer bring the plant into a spot that will provide it with a few hours daylight, stop giving it fertiliser, reduce watering and provide full darkness at night -- then you may see them bloom, in the winter. The plant will see this as a resting period.</p>

                              <p> The Flaming katy is a succulent plant that's part of the Kalanchoe genus. This plant is one of the most popular from this genus that naturally flowers in spring, although growers are able to have it blossoming at any time of the year. These have fleshy leaves that grow to approximately 2 inches long and flowers that bloom, tubular shaped. </p>
                              <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Blooming</strong>: In the past these plants were thrown away after the flowers died which is why they were better known as flowering gift plants. However, they can bloom many times, at any time of the year indoors. It's best to prune these back as soon as the existing flowers are spent or dead, which will encourage new buds and further flowering. Taking cuttings from the flaming katy and propagating them (easily done) will allow a grower to create new plants and provide a higher chance of seeing more flowers if the parent plant decides it no longer wants to produce more (it's easier than being concerned about the parent re-flowering).</p>
<p class="text-left">&nbsp;<strong>Level</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>care</strong>: Taking care of these is pretty easy and they may actually thank you for a little neglect. Getting them to re-flower is the difficult part, although as mentioned above you can just propagate new cuttings.</p>
                              <p class="text-left">&nbsp;<strong>Pets</strong>: The Kalanchoe plant is toxic to pets (dogs and cats), as advised by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), if consumed. The ASPCA advises owners to contact there veterinary clinic if their animal begins vomiting or has diarrhoea.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Lollipop Plant - Pachystachys Lutea</a></h3>
                              <p> The beautiful cone shaped yellow colored bract (more of a golden color) and white protruding blooms, makes this a very attractive flowering house plant choice. These have a long flowering season that gives them another reason to be attractive to those wanting a flowering indoor plant. The lollipop plant grows up to about 1.5 ft. </p>
                              <p><strong>Shrimp</strong> <strong>plant</strong>: While this perennial also has the common name of shrimp plant because of it's bract - that can look like shrimp when they're beginning to grow, there is also another named Mexican shrimp (I think this one looks more like shrimp). These two plants differ in the genus they belong to and the Mexican (Scientific name: Justicia brandegeeana) type has smaller leaves with arched flower heads, otherwise very similar.</p>
                              <p><strong>Leaves</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>flowers</strong>: The flowers that bloom from spring until fall are white in color and small, which peep through the golden flower head (bract - can be 5 inches long). The long evergreen leaves are dark green and oval shaped, with large veins. It's definitely the flower head that make this attractive.&nbsp;</p>
