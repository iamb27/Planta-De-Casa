                              <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Swiss Cheese Plant - Monstera Deliciosa</a></h3>
                                <p> The Monstera deliciosa is a species that attaches it self to trees in its natural rain forest habitat. This environment can be provided with a moss stick and other conditions. These enjoy shaded areas away from direct sunlight, warmth and humidity to grow well indoors. </p>
                              <p><strong>How</strong> <strong>they</strong> <strong>look</strong>: The monstera deliciosa is primarily grown indoors for the lush green and glossy leaves. Each heart shaped leaf that appears starts of as a full leaf and then begins to form it's slits. These leaves will grow whilst the plant is very young and only a matter of a few inches tall, although they do not produce the slits until it matures more. This species looks similar to a palm tree.</p>
                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>Flowering and fruit</strong>: The cheese plant does flower in it's natural habitat or somewhere that mimics it's natural habit very well. It's very rare to see them flower indoors. These flowers are a whitish colored spathe type with a spadix in the center.&nbsp;The fruit which looks similar to a sweetcorn cone (in shape) are produced after the the flowers have fully bloomed. There is a specific way of knowing these are ready to be eaten, and if they're eaten before they become ripe enough it has been said they can cause mouth irritation. The name deliciosa comes from the fruit being known as tasting delicious.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;<strong>Displaying and growing</strong>: These look fantastic in large rooms, hallways, within offices and anywhere else that can cater for their size and caring needs. To grow them tall they will have to be trained, which is fairly easy when using a moss stick. If you donâ€™t have the time or materials to make a moss pole you can purchase them online or in garden stores which is probably a cheaper method. In the wild this plant grows by climbing (climbing shrub) trees (epiphyte) so it gains it's support and moisture from them - which a moss pole is used to imitate</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Donkeys Tail Plant - Sedum Morganianum</a></h3>
                              <p> The Donkeys tail is a perfect plant suited for hanging baskets because of its trailing nature. This is a succulent from the Sedum genus. Be sure to not overwater, especially during winter (this can end up killing the plant). Most other growing conditions are easy enough to provide. </p>
<p><strong>Flowering</strong>:  This Sedum is a flowering plant and produces small flowers at the tips of the stems, however, they're difficult to find in bloom indoors. The taking outside during summer and providing direct sun will encourage them to flower. Also the resting in cooler temperatures during winter will help.</p>
                              <p><strong>Foliage</strong>: The foliage of this plant is the same as many other succulent species and has thick soft leaves, although small. The leaves that hang over the pot are green and grayish in color. You have to handle them with care to prevent leaves dropping (this is common). The leaves kind of overlap each other.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Heartleaf - Philodendron Scandens</a></h3>
                              <p> The Heartleaf philodendron is named so because of its heart shaped leaves. You may grow this trailing or climbing, although I reckon they look much better climbing on a moss stick than hanging (others like them trailing). Growing conditions in most homes are easy to care for the Heartleaf. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Flowering: </strong>This is not a plant that is particularly known for its stunning flowers but it does occasionally produce spathes of white flowers especially on mature plants. The flowers on this plant can appear at any time of the year but mainly in summer but it is common for those plants that are kept indoors to not flower. Whilst it is called a flower, the spathe that this plant produces is more like a flower holder and is a green color and oval in shape.</p>
                              
                              <p><strong>&nbsp;Foliage: </strong>This is a plant that can gain some incredible height but it is really known for its heart shaped leaves. The leaves can take on a number of different colors but in the main they become a dark and glossy green color but they can almost look transparent at times.&nbsp;The leaves can grow up to a length of 10 inches whilst its stems have the ability to grow to 4ft long or more but it can take up to ten years to reach its ultimate height. Its foliage remains green all year round making it the perfect evergreen plant for both the home and garden.</p>
<p><strong>Displaying and growing</strong>: The Heart leaf can be grown as a trailer or climber plant. To grow as a trailer pinch out the stem tips and allow the plant to grow bushy in appearance. Growing as a climber involves using a moss stick for the plant to attach to and climb. This in my opinion is the best way to grow and much more fun.</p>

                              <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Golden Pothos - Epipremnum Aureum</a></h3>
                              <p> This species is another climbing type plant with aerial roots that attach themselves to trees. In the UK it's knows as devils ivy. If you have any pets that enjoy chewing leaves, then you may want to avoid this plant because of its toxicity. While young and small in size its fine displayed in a pot on a shelf and then when it matures a moss stick is best suited to encourage climbing growth. </p>
                              <p><strong>How</strong> <strong>it</strong> <strong>looks</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>grows</strong>: The beauty of this plant is in its leaves. Each arrow shaped leaf will alternate location with the leaves around it. These leaves will grow up to 39 inches long (100 cm) and 18 inches across (45 cm). Even on juvenile plants, the leaves appear exactly the same as they do on mature plants, only as smaller versions of themselves. This makes this plant beautiful at any age. The tops of the leaves appear as a blotched marbled yellow and green combination, with each leaf being unique from the others on the vine. You may pinch off the leaves at the stems in order to shape the plant and control where it grows.</p>
                              <p><strong>Flowering</strong>: Although this plant does occasionally bloom in the wild, cases of blooms when grown indoors are extremely rare. The beauty of this plant is in the leaves, not in the flowers it creates. In the event that your indoor plant begins flowering, you may nip the flowers off below the bud when they are discovered. The flowers are nothing but a waste of energy to this plant.</p>
<p><strong>Poisonous</strong>:  Every part of this plant is poisonous to domestic animals and pets of all kinds, as well as to humans. Avoid having this plant in your home if you have pets or small children..</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Arrowhead Plant - Syngonium Podophyllum</a></h3>
                              <p> Similar species to the Heartleaf philodendron in terms of how its leaves look, care needs, and it's from the same plant family. The beauty of the Arrowhead is it can be displayed and grown as a bushy plant when pruned or it can be grown climbing. Many growers keep them small and bushy. Give them a go climbing a moss stick.....it's fun and leaves change shape when the plant matures. </p>
                              <p><strong>Fronds</strong> <strong>(leaves)</strong>: Foliage: An interesting growth pattern of the leaves is they begin cordate (heart) shaped then develop into the arrow shape and further on in age become palmate (similar shape to a hand). Because the plant matures into a climbing vine it will need to be cut back to prevent growth becoming wild and difficult to manage, indoors. If you want, you can grow these on a moss stick or a type of trellis (support for the stems and direct growth) if you preferred it growing with its natural climbing nature. Growing on a moss stick or another support they can grow up to 6ft tall. Most growers will keep the Arrowhead plant as a small bushy plant and pinch out the stems and prune.</p>
<p class="text-left">&nbsp;<strong>Flowers</strong>: Flowers seem to bloom more in its natural habitat and outdoors when the plant has matured. The flowers bloom within a spathe on a spadix similar to how a Peace lily and Philodendron plant does. If your pruning to keep the plant small and bushy flowers will not appear.</p>
                              <p class="text-left"><strong>Poisonous to pets</strong>: It's a good idea to keep your plant well away from cats and dogs. Although they are only mentioned to be mild to moderate in toxicity they will cause your pet to become unwell if ingested</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Creeping Fig - Ficus Pumila</a></h3>
                              <p> The creeping fig does just this well...creeps everywhere. Displaying very small heart shaped leaves on twiggy type stems suited for hanging baskets, climbing a trellis or moss stick. You see these outside homes (especially in the UK) crawling the walls of cottages and it is just so beautiful and traditional. Very easy to grow and tolerates low lighting and colder conditions. </p>
                              <p><strong>How</strong> <strong>it</strong> <strong>looks</strong>: The heart shaped leaves on the ficus pumila grow to approximatively 1 inch long and along a wiry wooden like stem. You can keep these very small in a normal sized plant pot, in a hanging basket, or a larger container where the stems and leaves can hang over the sides. If you would like to be more creative you can allow them to climb a moss stick or provide them with a home made structure they can climb.</p>
                              <p><strong>Care</strong> <strong>level</strong>: The F. pumila is very easy to grow and maintain (if anything it's hard to stop them growing), but it does need to be pruned to keep it at a size suitable for the place it resides indoors. The good news you can prune these as much as you like, which is best done in spring.</p>
