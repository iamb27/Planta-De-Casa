                              <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Spider Plant - Chlorophytum Comosum</a></h3>
                                <p> The spider plant is easy to care for and maintain - that's very popular in many countries. It has been grown indoors for over 200 years and flowers ( white) from the stems in the summer and spring. The flowers then produce baby Spiders that can be used for creating new plants. This is one of the easiest plants to grow/maintain, which has made it so popular, and a great beginners choice. </p>
                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>Minimal</strong> <strong>care</strong>: This plant can survive with minimal care/attention and can manage low temperatures. However, they will start to look very unattractive and create mess (leaves falling and browning) without enough water and light or too much of either. When they're taken care of properly they look great.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p><strong>How</strong> <strong>they</strong> <strong>look</strong>: As mentioned above if they are neglected they will look shabby and unattractive. When cared for the leaves grow upwards and arch out. The C.C. vittatum type (most popular) has green leaves with a white stripe in the center, and the C.C. variegatum has darker green leaves with white stripes on the edges of the leaf, mainly.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p><strong>Flowering</strong>: Small white star shaped flowers appear in loose clusters on the stems up-to 6ft long (max). Alongside flowers blooming small plant-lets grow, that can be detached and re-potted to produce more spider plants. Where they grow best: Because the leaves and especially the stems grow quite long, the spider plant is best to be placed in a hanging type basket, corner type shelf or table that allows the leaves and stems to grow freely. When they are young and small they are fine anywhere, that's away from direct sunlight.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;<strong>Air</strong> <strong>pollution</strong>: These have been tested and said to reduce air pollution significantly.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Aloe Vera - Aloe</a></h3>
                              <p> Aloe Vera is a succulent leaf plant that is well known for its health and beauty benefits. These are said to originate from Africa and they are grown/cultivated in various countries and homes, because they tolerate various conditions very well. The Aloe V is another popular and easy plant to care for. Take care of one well then you'll soon have pups to create new Aloe's. </p>
                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>Medicinal</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>health</strong> <strong>benefits</strong>: Aloe is available in juice for drinking (tastes good), skin care, coolant for sunburn and is also used for other purposes. There seems to be no satisfactory evidence of the benefits or safety of consuming or using A.vera products.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p><strong>Growing</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>care</strong>: For the indoor grower taking care of the A. Vera. These are slow growers and need your patience.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Flowers: Be aware that Aloes are not in any rush to bloom flowers (yellow in color on stems) for you, and it could take up to 3-4 years for one to mature, then flower. Also, keep in mind - they flower when they're kept outdoors mainly or have enough sunlight indoors. It is easy to assume that some do and some don't, based on the type and conditions (sunlight) they are given.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Peace Lily - Spathiphyllum Wallisii</a></h3>
                              <p> The Peace Lily is one of my all time favorites. Its minimalistic look, and the charming white flower (spathe) that blossoms makes it a great choice of plant for the home or office. These can be sensitive to the wrong amount of water and sunlight. The leaves have a nice glossy appearance which also makes this a popular and attractive plant. Once a plant matures you may divide sections for propagation. </p>
                              <p><strong>&nbsp;Removing pollutants</strong>: A study performed by NASA and Dr Wolverton to determine how plants can remove pollutants was conducted. As you can see, the list here tells us the peace lily removes benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethane, and others. .</p>
                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>Flowering</strong>: The white lily flowers (known as a spathe) begin blooming with a twist at first before flourishing and revealing it's yellow or white spadix in the center. The right light conditions are required for the flowers to bloom which can last a couple of months. I had one that produced one flower the first spring and then three the year later.. so it seems as they mature the more they can produce, with enough light. They usually bloom springtime, sometimes later.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p><strong>Foliage</strong>: The lance shaped (long..wide in the middle) dark green glossy leaves grow outwards and droop, and grow to around 6 inches long. Cleaning them gently with a soft sponge will keep them looking healthy and attractive.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>Where</strong> <strong>they</strong> <strong>like</strong> <strong>to reside</strong>: Because the peace lily is a fairly small plant in height and width they are suitable to place where you see fit. It's important to make sure the place has plenty of light, but not direct sunlight to prevent damaging the leaves. The best environment they prefer is light and shade throughout a day</p>

                              <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Jade Plant - Crassula Ovata</a></h3>
                              <p> The Jade plant is another common house plant that grows with a thick trunk and shiny oval shaped leaves. This is also a plant that I remember having in the home while growing up. Mother propagated (using leaf cuttings) many Jades, so we had plenty around the house. These are fairly easy to care for until they grow much larger. </p>
                              <p>&nbsp;</p>
                              <p><strong>&nbsp;Basic info:</strong> The Jade is grown indoors and borrows itself from the bonsai in the way it grows like a miniature tree, with a trunk and branches. It is also a succulent that will retain water well within the leaves, just like the cactus plant. This succulent is a hardy fellow and has two main requirements for a healthy long life, which is water and plenty of light. They are both an indoor and outdoor species, although conditions outside need to be right (enough heat and sun).&nbsp;</p>
                              <p><strong>How it looks and displaying:</strong> As mentioned above the Jade has a similar look to a bonsai tree with a thick trunk and branches. The leaves are a thick oval shaped type which are a shiny dark green and possibly red colored outer edge's. They can produce white or pink flowers in the right conditions, once they have matured. The most important aspect of displaying this shrub is plenty of sunlight.....close to a window.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p><strong>Easy to grow</strong>: As you will see with the care instructions below these are very easy to maintain, however, the more you see to it's basic needs, the better and stronger it will grow.</p>
                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>Flowering</strong>: Some growers have just been fortunate that theirs has bloomed while others have had to make the conditions right. Many have never seen one bloom in years (like me). The general advice is at the end of summer bring the plant into a spot that will provide it with a few hours daylight, stop giving it fertiliser, reduce watering and provide full darkness at night -- then you may see them bloom, in the winter. The plant will see this as a resting period.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">African Violet - Saintpaulia</a></h3>
                              <p> The African violet is a wonderful flowering type species that will flower at anytime of the year with proper care and conditions provided. These can be harder to take care of than the ones mentioned previously, but that just means they need a bit MORE love-and-attention. These need to have dead flowers and damaged leaves removed asap. </p>
                              <p><strong>&nbsp; Varieties and types</strong>: Saintpaulia is a genus comprising of approximately 20 species and subspecies, and many varietes. There are a fair few types including standard, trailers, miniatures, and chimeras (a basic way to put them into a category). Various species includes different sizes, flower colors and foliage types. A grower needs to understand which type they have if they plan to propagate them - the procedure is different (for the Chimera). There are actually thousands of hybrids with various flower colors/forms and leaf types available.</p>
                              <p class="text-center">&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Standard</strong>: The standard type usually grows to around 8in - 16in diameter or possibly more, and displays most of the colors/types that African violets can bloom.</p>
                              <p class="text-center"><strong>Miniature</strong>: The miniature is said to grow from approx 3in - 6in diameter "and they get smaller" with the micro-mini which is less than 3 inches. There is also the semi-miniature AV that grows from approx 6in - 8in (diameter). &nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="text-center">&nbsp;<strong>Large</strong>: Larger sized plants could be judged as above 16in (diameter).</p>
                              <p class="text-center">&nbsp;Trailing: Trailing AV plants are grown as trailers - whichever size it is. These are multi-crowned hybrids that grow well in hanging baskets, or fairly shallow pots.</p>
                              <p class="text-center">Chimera A.violets: Chimera is a strain of A.violets that produce distinct striped petals and have to be propagated from suckers, rather than leaf cuttings. Propagating from cuttings is not likely to produce the same plant that cuttings are taken from. This is because the plant cells are genetically different, which explains why they're propagated with suckers.</p>
                              <p class="text-left">&nbsp;<strong>Petals and leaves</strong>: There is a huge amount of various color combination's for petals, from pinks (Rococo pink) to the multi-colored double flowered Candy dandy (yep..some peculiar names indeed). The petals also have different shapes, edges, amounts - and can be double flowered. There are also various leaf varieties that includes names such as the boy, girl, variegated (green and white), spoon, holly, serrated and lance shaped.</p>
                              <p class="text-left">&nbsp;<strong>Blooming</strong>: Experts can keep these blooming for around 10 months or more a year - with the use of artificial lighting, correct temperatures and conditions. Basically, they can flower all year round, depending on how well they are cared for. You can expect the flowers to bloom for a few days - and upto a few weeks, although the length of time they flower depends very much on their environment/conditions.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Baby Rubber Plant - Peperomia</a></h3>
                              <p> Peperomias have become very common house plants including the Peperomia obtusifolia. Succulent rounded type leaves from the various cultivars may be dark green, mottled or variegated and they're relatively easy to propagate. They are flowering plants that produce flower spikes, but these flowers are non-showy. </p>
                              <p>Native to South America, the Peperomia obtusifolia is a perennial flowering epiphyte plant species. In its natural habitat it grows within high humidity forest areas making use of the nutrients provided from tree debris and the natural tropical environment. There are a number of cultivars including the dark green leaved, variegated and the Peperomia obtusifolia 'Albomarginata' that displays yellowy gold and green patched leaves.</p>
                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>Foliage</strong>: The primary attraction as an ornamental plant is the foliage and its growth habit is bushy in appearance. Glossy pelate leaves with petioles grow close to the main stems that are partly rounded and grow a few centimeters in length. Leaves have a fleshy succulent look and feel about them and the thin stems are non woody. Most will grow up to 25 - 30 cm in height and must be pinched out at the tips to direct, stop and encourage growth.</p>
                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>Flowers</strong>: The baby rubber plant can flower that are non-showy. White flower spikes with small white flowers may appear from spring - fall that grow 8 cm in height above the leaves, but as mentioned they are non-showy and not the attractive feature of this Peperomia.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>Care</strong> <strong>level</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>growing</strong>: Most of the Peperomias are easy enough to grow indoors and in containers including. Humidity and light are important. Windowsills, greenhouses and conservatories are ideal places to display this plant. Light is an important factor to consider when finding a spot indoors to grow a Peperomia obtusifolia.</p>
