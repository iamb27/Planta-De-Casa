                              <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">SPIDER PLANT</a></h3>
                                <p> The spider plant is very popular and can be found in many homes or offices. Most people have owned or lived with one (or many) at some point. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Flowering</strong>: This Sedum is a flowering plant and produces small flowers at the tips of the stems, however, they're difficult to find in bloom indoors. The taking outside during summer and providing direct sun will encourage them to flower. Also the resting in cooler temperatures during winter will help.</p>
                              <p><strong>Foliage</strong>: The foliage of this plant is the same as many other succulent species and has thick soft leaves, although small. The leaves that hang over the pot are green and grayish in color. You have to handle them with care to prevent leaves dropping (this is common). The leaves kind of overlap each other. </p>
                                <p>&nbsp;<strong>Minimal</strong> <strong>care</strong>: This plant can survive with minimal care/attention and can manage low temperatures. However, they will start to look very unattractive and create mess (leaves falling and browning) without enough water and light or too much of either. When they're taken care of properly they look great.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Donkeys Tail Plant - Sedum Morganianum</a></h3>
                              <p> The Donkeys tail is a perfect plant suited for hanging baskets because of its trailing nature. This is a succulent from the Sedum genus. Be sure to not overwater, especially during winter (this can end up killing the plant). Most other growing conditions are easy enough to provide. </p>
                              <p><strong>How</strong> <strong>it</strong> <strong>looks</strong>: This plant grows with one or more canes (stems) and then produces new stems and a crown of leaves near the top of the cane. These canes can grow up to 6 ft or more indoors or they can be cut at the top as soon as they reach a suitable height.</p>
                            <p><strong>Flowering</strong>: The corn plant produces fragrant flowers in it's natural habitat, but it's not likely to bloom indoors - although they can. It's the foliage that's the real attraction for this plant.</p>
                              <p><strong>Foliage</strong>: The foliage of this plant is the same as many other succulent species and has thick soft leaves, although small.

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Boston Fern - Nephrolepis Exaltata</a></h3>
                              <p> The Boston fern displays arching fronds with a feather like appearance growing up to 3ft in length that makes it suitable for growing in a hanging basket. This fern is quite easy to grow indoors, although you will need to pay particular attention to its care needs compared to other plants I have included within this selection. </p>
                              <p><strong>How</strong> <strong>it</strong> <strong>looks</strong>: As mentioned above the fronds on the Boston fern arch over and grow up to about 3 ft long. The fronds are made up of a tough leaf stalk, pinnate leaflets and a rachis (leaf stalk), but in layman's terms it's a kind of long stalk with lots of small leaves on it, side-by-side....or you could say they have a large feather like appearance.</p>

                              <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Rabbit's Foot - Davallia Fejeensis</a></h3>
                              <p> The Rabbit's foot is another Fern that can grow within a hanging basket quite happily. It received its common name because of the furry rhizomes that grow and creep. The fronds are similar to the Boston fern, although these grow in an upright fashion. Improving humidity levels and bright light with some shade will encourage success growing this species. </p>
                              <p><strong>How</strong> <strong>it</strong> <strong>looks</strong>&nbsp;: <strong>&nbsp;</strong> The fejeensis is easily recognisable as a fern because of it's fronds (grow upright) that display gauzy or lace like leaflets. The small leaves are attached to kind of wiry stalks that grow from the visible rhizomes. These furry and yellowish brown rhizomes creep over the pot; they are main feature of this species. It's important to keep in mind what pot the plant should be planted in so it can display it's rhizomes (within a hanging basket is common and a shallow pot).</p>
                              <p><strong>Level</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>care</strong>: Although the Rabbit's foot fern does seem to be a bit more resilient than many other ferns and less temperamental, I would treat it as a fern in terms of humidity. This means providing enough humidity that your likely to need to increase yourself and keep the soil moist.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Rat's Tail - Aporocactus Flagelliformis</a></h3>
                              <p> The Rat's tail is a flowering cactus that produces attractive tubular shaped flowers along any part of the stems. These flowers are pink in color and bloom during spring for up to 5 days or so. The stems that hang can grow a few feet long and have spines. Being a cacti makes this plant one of the easiest to maintain regarding its care requirements. </p>
                              <p><strong>How</strong> <strong>they</strong> <strong>look</strong>: As mentioned above the Rat's tail grows stems up to a few feet long, that hang and display brownish colored spines, which can be a bit sharp (do take care when handling). These stems are approximately 0.5 in/12.7mm --- 1 in/25.4mm thick. The flowers are a very attractive (2in - 4in / 5cm - 10cm wide) pink tubular type that usually bloom within spring for up to 5 days. These flowers will grow from any part of the stem and you can expect plenty of them. Overall, I would say some look more attractive than others, depending on how they grow. They attract growers that love their cacti and/or like quite unusual looking plants.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Growing</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>care</strong>: Similar to many other cacti plants they are very easy to grow indoors and outside (as long at the temperature is correct outside - see below), within a container or hanging basket - once they mature.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Wandering Jew - Tradescantia Fluminensis</a></h3>
                              <p> When the Wandering Jew is a young plant it does not make a great hanging basket plant, but when it matures the stems begin to hang making it a great choice (it grows fast). Flowers do appear, although they're not very showy. Very easy to care for and nothing special required to assist its growth apart from bright light etc. Pruning every season should be done. </p>
                              <p><strong>Foliage</strong>: Fleshy oval or lance shaped leaves are produced from the pendant stems (growing a couple of feet or so long). These small leaves have a shiny appearance and grow to about 2 - 4 inches long with pointed tips. The underside of a leaf is purple in color on the zebrina and new leaves appear purple at first, then turn green. In the wild or grown in gardens (grown as a bedding plant) stems take root at the nodes, but indoors in a hanging basket or container they grow and hang over the sides.</p>
                              <p><strong>Flowering</strong>: The small non showy flowers are white in color, appearing during summer usually and at other times (depending on the conditions). These flowers appear in clusters, and display three small petals.</p>
                              <p><strong>Care level and growing</strong>: Wandering jew plants are pretty simple to care for and maintain, although providing plenty of bright light is important. Tradescatia naturally become spindly and need to be pruned regularly and pinching stems will encourage fuller growth, improving it's appearance. </p>
