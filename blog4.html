                              <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Rat's Tail - Aporocactus Flagelliformis</a></h3>
                                <p> The rat's tail type is a good option for those that like to display hanging plants. At first glance it looks like a dread-lock type of hair style with flowers or a kind of Medusa look, because the stems grow outwards and hang over the pot. This blooms plenty of deep pink or red tubular shaped flowers along the stems. </p>
                              <p><strong>How</strong> <strong>they</strong> <strong>look</strong>: As mentioned above the Rat's tail grows stems up to a few feet long, that hang and display brownish colored spines, which can be a bit sharp (do take care when handling). These stems are approximately 0.5 in/12.7mm --- 1 in/25.4mm thick. The flowers are a very attractive (2in - 4in / 5cm - 10cm wide) pink tubular type that usually bloom within spring for up to 5 days. These flowers will grow from any part of the stem and you can expect plenty of them. Overall, I would say some look more attractive than others, depending on how they grow. They attract growers that love their cacti and/or like quite unusual looking plants.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;Growing and care: Similar to many other cacti plants they are very easy to grow indoors and outside (as long at the temperature is correct outside - see below), within a container or hanging basket - once they mature.</p>

                              <p> The Cereus peruvianus is also known as the columnar cactus because the stem's grow upright, similar to a column. The image to the left shows them growing with a single stem; however, they can grow many. There is some confusion in reference to the scientific and common names for this cacti. </p>
                              <p><strong>Varieties</strong>: There are a few varieties which get confused with this cacti, because they have similarities and grow with a column stem. For example, the difference between the C.peruvinus and C.jamacara cactus is the, spines (C.P brown - C.J yellow) and flowers (C.P are longer). Then there’s a deformed looking (stems and ribs are kind of twisted), slow growing, mutant type, that can not be confused with the Apple cactus at all - because it's so peculiar looking.</p>
                              <p><strong>Growing</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>care</strong>: Just like most cacti plants, these are very easy to grow indoors and need very little attention. Two of the main things to take care of is using a good draining cacti soil, and plenty of bright light (more about care and conditions below). An issue could arise when the plant matures, and finding a suitable room for it's height, although pruning the top will reduce it.</p>
                              <p>Displaying: Display in a room that gets plenty of sunlight and a solid (and heavy) container, for when it matures in size (to keep it sturdy and prevent it from toppling over). Many are kept in greenhouses or entrances to buildings and rooms for d้cor purposes.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Bunny Ears - Opuntia Microdasys</a></h3>
                              <p> The mother in laws tongue (also known as snake plant) is a flowering species which is primarily grown for it's slick looking long leaves. This is a slow growing plant which anyone can grow because of it's low or high sun light tolerance and ease of watering. I would put this species on the same par as the cast iron plant above, for being so easy to grow. </p>
                              <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>How</strong> <strong>It</strong> <strong>Looks</strong>: This cacti has no central stem or leaves. The individual segments which constitute the cactus body are oval shaped pads from which additional segments form. These new segments always grow in pairs, giving new growth areas the appearance of bunny ears. Newest segments grow in as a red color, and mature to dark green as they grow. Flowers will always sprout from the terminal ends of segment pads. The Polka-dot Cactus covers its mature pads with closely spaced glochids, or small mounds of prickles that are designed to detach when impacted by something. Once fully formed, the glochids form on the new plant segment. The glochids are so loosely attached that a strong breeze can cause them to go airborne.</p>
                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Flowering: </strong>Flowers only bud at the termination points of fully formed segments. Budding begins in late spring, and culminates in early summer with 2 inch wide blossoms. These are a creamy yellow in color, and fade to peach once fertilized. Flowers will turn into 2 inch long fruits varying from purple to red in color. Bloom encouragement is not needed.</p>

                              <p> The Christmas cacti plant is the most popular of the forest type and has similarities with the Easter cactus. The main difference between these two is the period when the flowers bloom. This blooms between November - January and the Easter species displays it's flowers in April or May </p>
                              <p><strong>How</strong> <strong>it</strong> <strong>looks:</strong>&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong>This cactus produces small, flat stem segments that are roundish in nature, with minor serrations on both sides. They flower from the end of these segments. The Christmas variety has neon pink pollen-bearing stamen. Along with the December blooming preference, this is the Cactus's defining feature.</p>
                              <p><strong>Flowering</strong>: The flower produces a unique, tube-shaped "double flower" appearance, with the "outer" flower being formed by shorter leaves that curl back near the flower's base, and the "inner" flower being formed further up the flower, near the stamen. They bloom from mid-November and January. If temperatures are kept steady near the 68°F (20°C) mark, flowering can continue for eight weeks or more. To induce flowering for the coming year, place your Christmas Cactus in a dark room for 12-14 hours on fall nights. For best flowering results, pinch off any plant segments less than 1 cm long in early September.</p>

                              <p> The parlor palm is one of the smaller indoor palms. Average room temperatures, not too much watering and just about enough light but not direct sunlight will keep this plant happy. Fully grown the neanthe bella (other common name used) will reach approximately 4ft tall and displays quite wide leaflets. </p>
                              <p><strong>Fronds</strong> <strong>(leaves)</strong>: The fronds on this palm grow and kind of droop or arch over from the stems once its matured, although it takes quite a bit of time for them to develop.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-left">&nbsp;<strong>Flowers</strong>: Some will sprout yellow flowers after a few years of growth and produce seeds, however, the seeds are not likely to grow future plants.</p>
                              <p class="text-left">&nbsp;<strong>Growth</strong> <strong>rate</strong>: These do take time to grow to a full size plant, as mentioned above. The amount of time may depend on its light conditions. They all need a few years regardless of conditions.</p>

                              <p> Orchid's are very popular cacti plant's that bloom and display beautiful flowers - with many petals, up to 4 -7 inches wide. There are a fair few of these named the orchid cacti that are not the Disocactus ackermannii, which are hybrids such as the Disocactus × hybridus or Epiphyllum hybrid. </p>
                              <p><strong>How</strong> <strong>it</strong> <strong>looks</strong>:&nbsp;Orchid's grows similar to tree plants or palms and has stems with many leaves growing from these stems. The leaves are a fleshy type which are only a couple of inches in length and an inch or so wide. Some of these stems from the same plant grow straight up and then others arch over, which may encourage you to prune odd looking stems to keep the plant looking full and shaped well.</p>
                              <p><strong>Flowering</strong>: Orchid'st does produce small flowers at the base of the plant when it's grown in it's own habitat or outdoors. The flower is a spathe type with a spadix that is not easily seen even when it does grow - because leaves can hide the flowers and they grow at the base of the stems.</p>
                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>Displaying</strong>: Orchid's is that fussy about where it is displayed. The place where it grows just needs to be able to accommodate it's size in diameter, which can become over 2ft once it matures - making a table area a nice place to display the plant. </p>
                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>Poisonous</strong>: All parts of this plant are said to be toxic if ingested by children, cats and dogs.</p>
