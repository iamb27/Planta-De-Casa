                                <p> The cast iron plant is one of the easiest house plants I have come across to care for. While this species does prefer bright light it survives well in shaded spots and rooms lacking natural light. The main way a grower can harm this plant is by over-watering or re-potting too often, so for those that forget about watering and care will love the aspidistra elatior </p>
<p><strong>How</strong> <strong>they</strong> <strong>look</strong>: The Rose of China is an attractive shrub with shiny dark green, toothed leaves. Five colorful petals bloom and a long staminal column (pollen stalk) sits in the center of the flower. At the right height indoors they look charming.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Corn Plant - Dracaena Fragrans</a></h3>
                              <p> This plant will grow best in bright light conditions, but it tolerates low light as well. Like other dracaenas it's a slow growing plant that tolerates neglect. Worst things to do is over water, sit it in direct sun for too long or let it get too cold. </p>
                              <p><strong>How</strong> <strong>it</strong> <strong>looks</strong>: This plant grows with one or more canes (stems) and then produces new stems and a crown of leaves near the top of the cane. These canes can grow up to 6 ft or more indoors or they can be cut at the top as soon as they reach a suitable height.</p>
                              <p><strong>Flowering</strong>: The corn plant produces fragrant flowers in it's natural habitat, but it's not likely to bloom indoors - although they can. It's the foliage that's the real attraction for this plant.</p>
                              <p><strong>Easy</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>grow</strong>: The corn plant is fairly easy to grow and quite tolerant of neglect (i.e., low light levels and lack of water), although it will start looking unattractive when neglected. The worst thing's to do with this plant is over water it or let it stay in direct sunlight for too long, otherwise it's a tough cookie.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;<strong>Removing</strong> <strong>toxins</strong>: The dracaena fragrans was a plant used in the NASA's clean air study which proved to remove a considerable amount of toxins from the environment.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Mother In Laws Tongue - Sansevieria T</a></h3>
                              <p> The mother in laws tongue (also known as snake plant) is a flowering species which is primarily grown for it's slick looking long leaves. This is a slow growing plant which anyone can grow because of it's low or high sun light tolerance and ease of watering. I would put this species on the same par as the cast iron plant above, for being so easy to grow. </p>
                              <p><strong>Varieties</strong>: There is a number of these succulent type varieties available that includes, golden edged leaves, white edged and the green and grayish mottled type. The golden edged leaf S. trifasciata laurentii is the most common of these.</p>
                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Flowering: </strong>Small greenish white flowers can appear once this species matures in age. This seems as though it happens by luck rather than effort for some growers. Keeping to the correct conditions gives the plant a higher chance of buds and then flowers appearing.</p>
                              
                              <p><strong>&nbsp;Foliage: </strong>The tall looking leathery upright leaves is what makes this succulent visually appealing rather than the flowers that may appear. The leaves are fleshy that sit within a rosette arrangement and can grow up to 3ft tall.</p>
<p><strong>Poisonous</strong> <strong>for</strong> <strong>pets</strong>: If cats or dogs ingest parts of this plant it can cause them to feel unwell, start vomiting or have diarrhoea. They are not highly toxic but still can cause uncomfortable symptoms.</p>

                              <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">Dragon Tree - Dracaena Marginata</a></h3>
                              <p> The dragon tree is another plant that is near impossible to kill. I have seen so many of these (including one I'm growing now) reach what seemed to be death, to see it return to it's full glory after re-potting and care. Direct sunlight and over-watering is not something the dracaena marginata likes at all. </p>
                              <p><strong>How</strong> <strong>it</strong> <strong>looks</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>grows</strong>: The leaves are quite slim compared to other Dracaena's with arching leaves. There are three types, one has a dark red outer edge leaves with a green center, another is green in the center with red and yellowish stripes and the other the colorama has thick red edges. The leaves are produced when the trunk grows stems (cane) from the side that often needs to be trained (keeps them growing upwards). These stems have a grayish brown bark (the trunk) that can also produce smaller ones, so the Dragon tree really needs to be pruned to avoid the plant from growing in all directions. These are slow grower's that can take about 10 years to reach over 5ft tall but look lush once they reach about a foot high. They have a very similar look like palm tree plants.</p>
                              <p><strong>Level</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>care</strong>: The Madagascar dragon tree is one of the easiest house plants to grow and takes neglect on the chin - then recovers quickly once the correct conditions and care is provided. The one I gave to my sister (about 5ft in height) over 10 years ago was neglected more than cared for and is now looking great.</p>
                              <p><strong>Leaves</strong> <strong>falling</strong>: If leaves start dying and coming away at the bottom of the plant - do not worry. This is natural and similar to how a yucca tree sheds its bottom leaves for new growth. You can remove them once you see them deteriorating in appearance.</p>
                              <p><strong>Poisonous</strong>: Poisonous: This plant is toxic to both cats and dogs.</p>
                              <p><strong>Improving</strong> <strong>air</strong> <strong>quality</strong>: The Dracaena marginata is one of the plants on NASA's air filtering plants list (part of the NASA clean air study) that reduces benzene, formaldehyde, xylene and toluene, within the air.</p>

                              <p> The parlor palm is one of the smaller indoor palms. Average room temperatures, not too much watering and just about enough light but not direct sunlight will keep this plant happy. Fully grown the neanthe bella (other common name used) will reach approximately 4ft tall and displays quite wide leaflets. </p>
                              <p><strong>Fronds</strong> <strong>(leaves)</strong>: The fronds on this palm grow and kind of droop or arch over from the stems once its matured, although it takes quite a bit of time for them to develop.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-left">&nbsp;<strong>Flowers</strong>: Some will sprout yellow flowers after a few years of growth and produce seeds, however, the seeds are not likely to grow future plants.</p>
                              <p class="text-left">&nbsp;<strong>Growth</strong> <strong>rate</strong>: These do take time to grow to a full size plant, as mentioned above. The amount of time may depend on its light conditions. They all need a few years regardless of conditions.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center"><a href="#">ZZ Plant - Zamioculcas Zamiifolia</a></h3>
                              <p> The worst thing you can do to a ZZ plant is over water it, otherwise it survives well, even with a certain amount of neglect. This easy to grow plant will grow well in low lighting conditions and with bright light, so you can't go wrong, really. It's appearance is like a small tree or bush. </p>
                              <p><strong>How</strong> <strong>it</strong> <strong>looks</strong>: The ZZ plant grows similar to tree plants or palms and has stems with many leaves growing from these stems. The leaves are a fleshy type which are only a couple of inches in length and an inch or so wide. Some of these stems from the same plant grow straight up and then others arch over, which may encourage you to prune odd looking stems to keep the plant looking full and shaped well.</p>
                              <p><strong>Flowering</strong>: The ZZ plant does produce small flowers at the base of the plant when it's grown in it's own habitat or outdoors. The flower is a spathe type with a spadix that is not easily seen even when it does grow - because leaves can hide the flowers and they grow at the base of the stems.</p>
                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>Displaying</strong>: I can't say the zz plant is that fussy about where it is displayed. The place where it grows just needs to be able to accommodate it's size in diameter, which can become over 2ft once it matures - making a table area a nice place to display the plant. </p>
                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>Poisonous</strong>: All parts of this plant are said to be toxic if ingested by children, cats and dogs.</p>
